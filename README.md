# D2D-Armour
Usable armour items that applies clothing to your character aswell as sound effects. When the player dies it removes the component from their body.

The armour cannot be stacked or exploited.

Installation guide:

1) Import SQL file into your databse.
2) Drag and Drop "D2D-Armour" into your resource directory.
3) Add "D2D-Armour" into your "Server.CFG"
4) Add item png's into your inventory system (if you wish)
5) Restart server & Enjoy!

I am working on a fix for the script to recognise male/female peds so the vests match up.

Do not redistrubite or sell this as your own!
